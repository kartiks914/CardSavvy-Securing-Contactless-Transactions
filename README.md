# RFIED-BLOCKER-for-rular-demography
The objective of our project is to create awareness about RFID among the rural and suburban demography. The idea behind this project is to prevent the cloning of data that can be used against the user. Alarming of a theft, i.e., usage of an authentication system that ensures the user is alarmed of the intruder activity.
